To remember Vishnu Sahastranaam, I want to be able to play the shloka/verse and read the Sanskit. If needed, I should be able to play it in a loop. Also, I want to understand meaning of the words(currently in Marathi).

 - This can be accessed on any smart phones, tablets and also on computers
 - When we hover over a word, a pop-up comes up with the meaning
 - When we click on music button, it plays the shloka
 - To keep practicing you can play the shloka in loop by clicking the loop-arrows
 - To stop the audio, you can click on the buttons or click anywhere outside on the screen
